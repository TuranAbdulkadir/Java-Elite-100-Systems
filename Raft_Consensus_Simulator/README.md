# Raft_Consensus_Simulator

## Project Overview
A simulation of the **Raft Consensus Algorithm**. It demonstrates how distributed nodes agree on a Leader state and handle transitions between Follower, Candidate, and Leader roles.

## Roles
* **Leader:** Handles requests
* **Follower:** Replicates logs
