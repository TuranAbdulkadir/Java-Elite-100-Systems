# Network_Packet_Fragmentation

## Project Overview
A simulation of IP **Packet Fragmentation**. It takes a large data payload and splits it into smaller packets based on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size, reassembling them at the destination.

## Tech Stack
* **MTU:** 1500 Bytes (Simulated as 10 chars)
* **Logic:** Offset Calculation
