# Service_Discovery_Registry

## Project Overview
A simulation of a **Service Discovery Server** (like Netflix Eureka). It acts as a central registry where microservices register themselves (IP/Port) so others can find them dynamically without hardcoded URLs.

## Logic
* **Register:** Service joins network
* **Heartbeat:** Service keeps connection alive
