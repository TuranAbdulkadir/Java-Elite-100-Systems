# Physics_Engine_Collision_2D

## Project Overview
A 2D Physics Engine simulating rigid body dynamics. It implements **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)** collision detection to check if objects overlap and calculates basic rebound physics.

## Tech Stack
* **Physics:** Kinematics
* **Collision:** AABB Algorithm
