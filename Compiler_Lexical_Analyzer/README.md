# Compiler_Lexical_Analyzer

## Project Overview
A **Lexer (Tokenizer)** for a custom programming language. It scans source code character by character and groups them into meaningful tokens (Keywords, Identifiers, Numbers, Operators), which is the first step of compilation.

## Tech Stack
* **Logic:** Finite Automata
* **Output:** Token Stream
