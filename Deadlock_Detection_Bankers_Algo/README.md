# Deadlock_Detection_Bankers_Algo

## Project Overview
An implementation of **Dijkstra's Banker's Algorithm**. It checks if granting a resource request (e.g., Printer, Memory) will lead to a **Safe State** or an Unsafe State (Deadlock), deciding whether to approve it.

## Logic
* **State:** Safe / Unsafe
* **Check:** Resource Availability
