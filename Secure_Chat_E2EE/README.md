# Secure_Chat_E2EE

## Project Overview
A simulation of **End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE)** messaging. Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the recipient's private key, ensuring the server sees only ciphertext.

## Tech Stack
* **Key Exchange:** ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) simulation
* **Encryption:** AES
