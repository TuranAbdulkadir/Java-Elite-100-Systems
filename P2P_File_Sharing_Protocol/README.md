# P2P_File_Sharing_Protocol

## Project Overview
A simulation of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing protocol. Peers act as both clients and servers (Leechers and Seeders), sharing file chunks without a central server, mimicking **BitTorrent** architecture.

## Architecture
* **Decentralized:** No single point of failure
* **Chunking:** File segmentation
