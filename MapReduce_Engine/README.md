# MapReduce_Engine

## Project Overview
A simplified MapReduce framework implementation. It processes large datasets by splitting the task into two phases: **Mapping** (Key-Value pairing) and **Reducing** (Aggregating results), optimized for parallel processing.

## Logic
* **Map:** Input -> Key, Value
* **Reduce:** Key, List<Values> -> Result
