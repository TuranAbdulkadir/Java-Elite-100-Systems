# RayTracing_Render_Engine

## Project Overview
A basic **Ray Tracing Engine** implementation. It simulates how light rays interact with objects (Spheres) to calculate pixel colors, creating realistic lighting and shading effects mathematically.

## Tech Stack
* **Math:** Vector Calculus (Dot Product)
* **Logic:** Ray-Sphere Intersection
