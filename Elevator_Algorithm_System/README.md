# Elevator_Algorithm_System

## Project Overview
An implementation of the **Elevator Scheduling Algorithm** (SCAN/LOOK). It efficiently serves multiple floor requests by prioritizing direction, simulating real-world building logic.

## Logic
* **Algorithm:** SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
* **Optimization:** Minimize wait time
