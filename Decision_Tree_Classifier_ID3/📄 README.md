# 🌳 014_Decision_Tree_Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview
A simplified Machine Learning classifier based on the **ID3 Algorithm**. It builds a decision tree by calculating **Entropy** and **Information Gain** to split data and make predictions.

## 🛠️ Concepts
* **Entropy:** Measure of impurity
* **Information Gain:** Best attribute selection
